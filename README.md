# Capstone-Project-EPICODE-introduction-
Greetings everyone, this is the explaination for my final project in the full stack developer course with EPICODE.

I have realized an e-commerce called NexVerseGames, that simulate a web site specialized in the sales of digital products, in this specific case video games. The site is completely functional and consent the users to create a new profile, add games to a private wishlist, buy games with simulated payment, and add the games in a user specific collection. The site present a vibrant and clean user interface to intrigue the customers. The project is realized with react (combining html,css and JavaScript knowledge) for the front-end and Java with Spring boot and PostgreSQL for the back-end. 

This are the link to acces the repositories for the project:
